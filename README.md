# gene_count_normalization
### R script for gene count normalization (RPKM, TPM) and density plots from featureCounts data

- Reads **featureCounts** output tables
- Calculates:
  - **RPKM (Reads Per Kilobase Million)**
  - **TPM (Transcripts Per Million)**
- Generates **density plots** (before and after normalization)
- Saves normalized matrices as **CSV**
- Saves plots in a **PDF** file
